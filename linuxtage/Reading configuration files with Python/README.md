# Reading configuration files with Python

This is a lightning talk from the [Grazer Linuxtage](https://www.linuxtage.at/) 2023.

It describes how to read configuration files in JSON, YAML and TOML and also validate them.

To run the example code, you need Python 3.11+ and a virtualization package like virtualenv.

Then set up the environment:

```bash
virtualenv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And finally run the example:

```bash
python example.py
```
